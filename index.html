                <h3>&#x1F320 Today's Insight:</h3>
                <p><i>"Discipline isn't about motivation, but about repeated intention."</i></p>
                <p>Today I learned that the desire to <i>take a short break</i> is often more tempting than long-term goals. But once I started, it turned out not to be as difficult as I thought.</p>

                <h3>&#x1F4AC Free Notes:</h3>
                <p>Well, I learned that it's never too late to start. Just be confident that you want to do it and grow. You want to become the best version of yourself today and tomorrow. You don't need much validation, you yourself, you have to fight alone, no one else you can rely on, the only one you can rely on is yourself. You're the one who can control yourself. Keep making effort and trusting in God's plan, and you'll be given ease. Just go through it first, then it will become a habit. And don't let there be the word 'later', if you can do it now, why not?</p>
